# Python OOP - June 2022

### Course Description

In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation in the programming. The main concept of OOP is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.
